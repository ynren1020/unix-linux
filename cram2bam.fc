##data were stored in *.cram format for saving space. To do featureCounts, we need to convert cram to bam by samtools.##
##Following is an example showing how to pipe cram/bam,index, featureCounts and rm *bam file (save space) together. ##
##&& connect commands together and assure the previous command finished successfully before running the next one. ##
