The shell can do this pretty easily (here assuming ksh93, zsh, bash, mksh, yash or (some builds of) busybox sh 
for the ${var//pattern/replacement} operator):

# To rename all of the files in the current directory that currently have spaces in their filenames:

for file in *' '*
do
  mv -- "$file" "${file// /_}"
done
