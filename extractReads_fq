##extract reads from fastq file based on the ids saved in a list##
way 1:
software: /home/yang4414/renxx275/software/seqtk/seqtk   (heng liâ€™s tool for dealing with fastq file)
/home/yang4414/renxx275/software/seqtk/seqtk subseq flnc.fastq colo829T.list > flnc.colo829T.fastq  (the file is empty?)
way 2:
Use this simple command of grep, I successfully grab the reads with specific ids from pacbio flank.fastq file downloaded from melanoma website.
grep -F -f colo829T.list -A 3 flnc.fastq > flnc.colo829T.fastq
