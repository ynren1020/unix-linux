##sometimes, we need to run same command on a series of same type files placed in different paths (nested in different levels, for example), 
##here is a simple way we can extract the pathway and file names and output to a *.txt file for furthur use. Alternatively, you can also apply
##python or R to find those files
##output all cram files pathway (total 11097 files)
ls */*/*.cram >/home/yren/project/pacbio/tcga/3star.txt
â€¦
ls */*/*/*/*/*.cram >/home/yren/project/pacbio/tcga/6star.txt
